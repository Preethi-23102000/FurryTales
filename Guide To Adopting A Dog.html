        <h3 style="color:#660099;">16 THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE ADOPTING A DOG</h3>
        <p>
          You’re an animal lover who wants to make the compassionate decision to adopt a furry BFF.
          You’ve probably spent hours trying to convince mom and dad that you’re ready to take on the
           role of a full-time dog guardian. You probably even know the closest shelters after spending so much time browsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while your heart might be ready to shower a dog with love,
          it’s important to consider whether you have enough time, space,
          and money to add a new memberto your family because caring for an
           animal is a big commitment.
        </p>

        <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (1).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
          Here are 16 things you need to think about before you and your family welcome a rescued pup into your home:
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">1. Take your time making a decision.</h4>
        <p>
        With all of the adorable “fur babies” in need of homes, you might be tempted to make a snap decision.
        However, it will be better for your future furry BFF if you put a lot of thought into it. For example,
        do you live in an apartment, or a house with a yard? Does your family travel a lot? Who will be there
        to let your dog out when you’re not home? Do your siblings want a new dog as much as you do?
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">2. Adopting means getting your pup from a shelter.</h4>
        <p>
          Even though there are many wonderful dogs waiting in shelters for someone to adopt them,
          breeders and pet stores continue to produce and sell animals just to make money.
          For every dog bought from a pet store or breeder, a dog in a shelter has to be put to sleep.
          Pet stores cause countless dogs to suffer, so adopt your pup from a shelter instead.
        </p>
        <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (2).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">3. Make sure your family’s wallet can handle it!.</h4>
        <p>
          Dogs require a lot of care that can quickly add up to big bucks.
          When you’re responsible for a dog, you need to spend money on regular and emergency vet visits
          , bedding, a collar and harness, high-quality dog food, treats, toys, grooming … the list goes on.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">4. It’s so important to get your dog spayed or neutered.</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (3).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
        Every year 6 to 8 million animals in India are left at animal shelters, and half of them are put to sleep just because there aren’t enough good homes for them all.
        Can you imagine if you were killed simply because there wasn’t enough room for you in the world? The only way to help stop this is to make sure that no more
        unwanted puppies are born.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">5. Dog tags and microchipping are a must!</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (4).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
        Accidents happen and you never know if and when your dog will get lost or run away. If you couldn’t find your way back home, you’d be able to call someone for help,
        but that’s not the case with dogs. Get a collar with proper tags that have your dog’s name and at least two phone numbers for you or your family. Microchipping
         is another great way to make sure your dog gets back home again! If you move, make sure you update the tags and give the microchip company your new information.
           </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">6. Dogs need their teeth brushed, just like humans.</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (5).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
        Seriously! Dental health is important for overall health, so remember to brush your furry BFF’s chompers several times a week.
        Introduce the toothbrush slowly and gradually, with lots of positive reinforcement. You can make this a fun routine by rewarding your dog after each brushing.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">7. Don’t forget about your furry friend’s nails …</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (6).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Dogs’ nails should be trimmed regularly so that they don’t break, get snagged on something ,
         or get so long that they interfere with normal walking—if dogs’ nails grow too long, it can affect their gait
         and even their nervous system. Some dogs hate having their paws handled, but you can always take your pup to
         the vet or groomer once a month and let them handle it!
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">8. … and fur!</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (7).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Brushing dogs regularly helps prevent nasty matting and increases circulation to the skin—which keeps it healthy! Spending that quality
        time together can also be a nice bonding experience. Some pups need professional grooming, so sit down with your parents and read up on
        how much upkeep your new friend’s coat will need. Dogs don’t really need baths very often. It’s only necessary if they have a skin condition
        or if they roll in something smelly or dirty, so don’t go overboard with the shampoo—it can dry out their skin and remove important natural oils if used too often.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">9. Keep an eye on what your dog eats.</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (8).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Some foods that are fine for people to eat can be poisonous to dogs. High up on the list is chocolate—but that’s not all.
        There’re lots of “human foods” that could also be harmful—like onions, grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, and more.
        It’s also important to feed your pup high-quality dog food and treats, and be careful not to overfeed—obesity
        causes major health problems in dogs and makes them very uncomfortable. And regular meals are much healthier than leaving food out all day long.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">10. Dogs need toys and entertainment.</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (9).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Before adopting a dog, it’s important to pup-proof your home. Hide dangerous items such as chemicals, electrical wiring,
        and sharp objects—ask your parents to help you find good places for these things. But also, put away anything that could
        be viewed by your new dog as a toy. If you don’t want your homework or favorite pillow chewed up, be sure to keep them out
        of your furry friend’s reach. Leave plenty of dog-friendly chew toys out—you don’t like being bored, and neither will your furry BFF!
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">11. Dogs also need exercise!</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (10).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        This one might seem like a no-brainer because of course pups need to run around. But sometimes people don’t realize just how much exercise their
        new pooch will really need. Dogs need to go on at least one long walk every single day. Play games like fetch or “hide and seek” with your furry BFF
        when you get home from school to help release some of that wild doggie energy. Plenty of exercise and fresh air makes for a happy pup and, as they say,
        “A tired dog is a well-behaved dog.”
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">12. Start training your new dog ASAP.</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (11).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        This is a big one. The key to having a happy dog is setting clear rules and boundaries. It’s important to guide new pups with positive rewards.
         They’ll repeat good behavior if they’re praised for it—just like human kiddos! Don’t ever lock them in a crate or yell at them for
         “misbehaving”—that will just make them afraid of you. Dogs can’t possibly know how you want them to behave until you and your family teach them.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">13. Prevent fleas, ticks, and worms.</h4>

      <p>
        This is especially important from late spring into the fall, when these little critters are the most common. Ask your parents to purchase products that
        keep fleas and ticks off your dog (such as Comfortis) from your vet. And don’t forget about heartworms! Where there are mosquitos in India., you can usually
        find heartworms—and heartworm disease can kill dogs. Thankfully, heartworm prevention is as simple as giving your dog a monthly medication.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">14. NEVER leave your dog chained up outdoors …</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (12).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        It’s hard to imagine that anyone could ever leave their dog all alone outside to suffer, especially in bad weather,
        but unfortunately some do. It’s cruel and dangerous. If you know anyone who does this, speak up! Have your parents call animal control or local authorities.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">15. … and never leave your dog in the car!</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (13).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Temperatures inside cars can skyrocket in a matter of minutes—even if it’s not particularly hot outside.
        If you see a dog locked inside a hot car, ask your parents to report it to the police or animal control immediately. You could save a life!
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">16. Give your canine pal plenty of love and affection.</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/dogAdoption (14).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Remember, a dog’s life is much, much shorter than the average human’s life. It goes by quickly, so be your pup’s BFF and show your love every single day!
