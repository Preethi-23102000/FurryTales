        <h3 style="color:#660099;">10 THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE ADOPTING A CAT</h3>
        <p>
          Adopting an animal is a major commitment.Here are 10 questions you should ask yourself before making a decision :<p>
          </p>

        <h4 style="color:#660099;">1. What will your life be like in five or even 10 years?</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (7).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">

        <p>
      A dog or cat can live 15 or more years, so envisioning how pet-friendly your life will be in the future is important.
      Consider whether you’re likely to be married, have children, move, change careers or undergo other major life changes.
      And keep in mind that as pets age, their needs change as well.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">2. Will you be adopting the pet by yourself or with someone?</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (8).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
          If you have a roommate or spouse, make sure that he or she is totally committed to a new pet.
          And even if everyone is on board with the idea of getting a pet, it’s important for people in the household to express concerns ahead of time,
          For instance, if shedding is a problem for someone, you may want to aim for a cat with a shorter coat.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">3. How much time can you dedicate to your pet each day?</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (7).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
          Though dogs generally require more time and attention than cats, you should be able to give any pet your undivided attention.
          Cats who don’t receive daily interaction have a greater risk of developing behavioral problems, anxiety and obesity.Pets need and deserve real engagement,
          such as playing and walking, in addition to cuddles and snuggles.
        </p>

        <h4 style="color:#660099;">4. Can you afford to own an animal?</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (9).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>

          Even if the cost of the pet itself is negligible, you need to factor in food, supplies and vet visits.
      If you plan to split the costs with someone, make sure you’re all in agreement about the amount that will be spent on the pet.
      Talking about costs in advance helps avoid surprisesyou . Owners are advised to consider insurance when pets are young.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">5. Do you have support from others if you’re working late or traveling?</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (1).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
          Many behavioral problems and even bladder infections result from not having a reliable system in place to relieve pets who are confined indoors.
           That’s why it is  suggests looking into boarding facilities, sitters and daycare before you adopt.

         </p>
        <h4 style="color:#660099;">6. How much household destruction can you tolerate?</h4>
        <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (10).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
        <p>
        Accidents are a given when you bring a pet into your life. There will be misunderstandings, miscommunications and missed potty breaks.
        The best advice: Be patient. Within a few weeks of regular training, you’ll be well on your way to a dream relationship.


          </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">  7. If you already have a pet, is that animal likely to accept a new housemate?</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (2).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
    <p>
        The good news is that most pets, even the most spoiled cats, crave companionship. Having multipets  helps to reduce stress and anxiety and foster healthy interspecies behavior.
        Of course, it may take some time for an existing pet to accept a new addition.it is suggested introducing animals to each other before adoption. It gives you a chance to watch them interact and see if they’ll be amiable housemates.


        </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">8. What do you hope to get out of the relationship?</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (3).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Our best friends are often those we enjoy doing things with, So make sure you have a plan to find the best buddy for your lifestyle.
      You should consider not just what you expect from a pet, but what you have to offer your new pet. The best chances of a great match start when you identify expectations and remain realistic about the relationship.


          </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">9. Shelter Cats are a great option.</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (5).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
      There's a misconception that animals in shelters have physical or behavioral issues; most of the time, that's not the case. Animals primarily end up in our care because of challenges and transitions that exist in the lives of the people responsible for their care.
      Often animals can end up in shelters when their humans move, lose a job, or have to focus on non-pet-related stressors—and that's not a reflection on the cats who now need a new home.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color:#660099;">10. Do you have small children?</h4>
      <img src="Asset/images/cat Adoption (6).png" alt="Dog Adoption" class="center">
      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, there is no species or breed that comes ready to live with kids.
        If you have children, you must first teach them the rules of safe pet conduct: No teasing, pulling, pushing or climbing on animals.
        You’ll also need to spend ample time meeting different animals, so you can observe tolerance levels, responsiveness to training and the
        ability to bounce back from jarring incidents.
